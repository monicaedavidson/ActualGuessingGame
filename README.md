This code is for the assignment, "Make your own Guessing Game." Collaborators are Monica Davidson and also, Brook Riggio helped with code format.

This code is designed for a user to guess my (Monica Davidson's) favorite city ("Seattle").

This code has two variables. The first one is "guess" which is the user's guess for what city. The second variable, "answer" is the correct answer; which is "Seattle".

This code is surrounded by a do/while loop that will loop over and over until the user guesses the correct city. After the correct city is inputed (or the user wishes to exit), the loop will end and result in a "Goodbye :)" dialog box.

When the game is first entered, a prompt appears asking the user to guess my favorite city and also gives a hint. For every time that the user's answer does not equal "Seattle," the dialog box tells them that that is incorrect and to keep trying, along with a hint.

If the user inputs the answer of "San Diego," a different dialog pops up that says I like California but the answer is incorrect, along with a hint.

Once the user has correctly guessed "Seattle," a dialog box will appear that says they have correctly guessed and then will exit and say "Goodbye :)"

.toUpperCase was used to allow the user to use both lower and uppercase in their answers.
